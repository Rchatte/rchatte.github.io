                      Hello, my name is Rohan Chatterjee. In May 2023, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from CSULA, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in both Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering.
                      During my time at Cal State LA, I served as an Instructional Teaching Assistant for the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology,
                      mentored students in the Biomedical Engineering Women Innovators Program, and worked as a Tutor at the Center for Academic Success.I was also named
                         to the Dean's list for all consecutive years of my undergraduate career and assisted in research under Dr. Navid Amini at CSULA's Machine Learning
                        and Sensing Lab. My future goal is to pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on research related to Machine Learning nd Medical Technology.

                          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become an essential tool for imaging of the retina to perform diagnosis 
                            and management of ocular and non-ocular diseases. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of structural similarity (SSIM) and multiscale 
                            structural similarity (MS-SSIM) metrics in comparing cross-sectional OCT images of the retina. We will then propose new metrics that only
                             consider areas with a high signal-to-noise ratio in retinal OCT images. Our experimental comparisons demonstrate that, as opposed to SSIM 
                             and MS-SSIM measurements, the proposed metrics, called ROI-SSIM and ROI-MS-SSIM, more effectively extract structural information from OCT 
                             images and hence, yield similarity values more reflective of human visual perception.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acute ischemic strokes (AIS) caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO) have been shown to result in significant 
                          rates of post-stroke dependence and mortality. Rapid detection of LVOs is essential for timely treatment to mitigate long-term functional 
                          and psychological consequences. The standard approach for LVO detection involves manual analysis of computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
                          brain scans, often leading to treatment delays due to the limited availability of experienced radiologists. In this paper, we propose a 
                          novel Three-Dimensional Deep Residual Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (DRDCNet-3D) that utilizes the power of dilated convolutions 
                          to enhance the spatial resolution for rapid detection of LVOs directly from CTA brain scans. Using a recent publicly-available dataset, 
                          we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.90, which is, on average, a 20% increase from the 
                          currently available open-source state-of-the-art 3D image analysis modelsâ€”demonstrating its effectiveness in the diagnosis of LVOs. Our 
                          approach can assist physicians in swiftly determining the optimal treatment strategies for patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, 
                          mitigating the risk of permanent severe damage.</p>

                        <p class="project-description"> <strong>Description:</strong> RNA splicing is a highly regulated RNA processing mechanism, where introns are removed and exons are ligated to
                           produce mature mRNA. Additionally, RNA splicing is a primary link between genetic variations and complex traits.3 RNA splicing is highly
                          tissue specific, with a particularly high frequency and complex alternative splicing patterns in brain tissues. Many studies have shown that
                           phenotypical changes in the prefrontal cortex are associated with schizophrenia. However, the genetic basis of dysregulated splicing in 
                           schizophrenia is not fully understood. Therefore, this study examined RNA-seq data from the Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 
                           schizophrenia and control samples. We implemented the Allele Specific Alternative mRNA processing (ASARP) method, to identify genetically 
                           influenced Allele Specific Alternative Splicing (ASAS) events and Allele Specific Expression (ASE) events that contribute to schizophrenia.
                            Our approach has identified several genes with allele specific expression and alternative splicing events. Our results provide an improved 
                            understanding of the genetically driven ASAS and ASE associated with schizophrenia. </p>
